# ICS212
Welcome to my repository for ICS 212, where I've compiled all my homework and project files from the course. This repository includes a variety of assignments and projects, each demonstrating different aspects of C, C++, and java that were covered throughout the class.

## Tools and Environment
- Developed using Vim in a terminal on an SSH UHUNIX server
- Makefile included for automatic compilation of project files and certain homeworks
